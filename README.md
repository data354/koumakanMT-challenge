# koumakanMT-challenge

The koumakanMT challenge aims to build a machine translation model that translates the Dyula language (dyu) (source language) into French (fr) (target language). In this repository, you'll find resources to get you started.

The notebooks folder contains the following files:
- **starter_notebook.ipynb**: A notebook for training the model and generating predictions for the test data.
- **inference_notebook.ipynb**: A notebook for inference with the baseline model.
